TFW is a Chrome Extension that allows you to organize the Twitch streamers you follow the way you want. Sort them out by folders, content, and have a better overview when deciding what you are going to watch.

**Note:** This is a work in progress and is far from being completely ready, only install it if you want to help improve it!
